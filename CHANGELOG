- Semantic versioning


## [Unreleased -> 2.0.0]

### Fixed
 - removed unnecessary computation of grayscale image in difference hash
 - difference hash now computes the padding byte correctly
 - Typo in hashing algorithm "bitResoluation" -> "bitResolution". Since this is a protected field
 which most likely is used in any derived hashing algorithm this is classified as a breaking change!
 - Due to a major version bump the dHash (this is an active TODO) will be revisited and it's implementation
 might change to not waste one bit. This will lead to all created hashes so far to be invalidated. The algorithm id of dHash will be updated
 accordingly.

### Changed
- Starting with version 2 hashes now use Luminocity as given by YCrCb instead of interpolated grayscale values.
- Hash classes migrate to use FastPixel access speeding up creation of higher key hashes by magnitude

### Added
 - Minor javadocs addition
